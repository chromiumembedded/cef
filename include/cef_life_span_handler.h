  /// be called if the browser's host window/view has already been destroyed
  /// (via parent window/view hierarchy tear-down, for example), as it is no
  /// longer possible to customize the close behavior at that point.
  ///
  /// An application should handle top-level parent window close notifications
  /// by calling CefBrowserHost::TryCloseBrowser() or
  /// CefBrowserHost::CloseBrowser(false) instead of allowing the window to
  /// close immediately (see the examples below). This gives CEF an opportunity
  /// to process JavaScript unload handlers and optionally cancel the close
  /// before DoClose() is called.
  ///
  /// When windowed rendering is enabled CEF will create an internal child
  /// window/view to host the browser. In that case returning false from
  /// DoClose() will send the standard close notification to the browser's
  /// top-level parent window (e.g. WM_CLOSE on Windows, performClose: on OS X,
  /// "delete_event" on Linux or CefWindowDelegate::CanClose() callback from
  /// Views).
  ///
  /// When windowed rendering is disabled there is no internal window/view
  /// and returning false from DoClose() will cause the browser object to be
  /// destroyed immediately.
  ///
  /// If the browser's top-level parent window requires a non-standard close
  /// notification then send that notification from DoClose() and return true.
  /// You are still required to complete the browser close as soon as possible
  /// (either by calling [Try]CloseBrowser() or by proceeding with window/view
  /// hierarchy tear-down), otherwise the browser will be left in a partially
  /// closed state that interferes with proper functioning. Top-level windows
  /// created on the browser process UI thread can alternately call
  /// CefBrowserHost::IsReadyToBeClosed() in the close handler to check close
  /// status instead of relying on custom DoClose() handling. See documentation
  /// on that method for additional details.
  ///
  /// The CefLifeSpanHandler::OnBeforeClose() method will be called after
  /// DoClose() (if DoClose() is called) and immediately before the browser
  /// object is destroyed. The application should only exit after
  /// OnBeforeClose() has been called for all existing browsers.
  ///
  /// The below examples describe what should happen during window close when
  /// the browser is parented to an application-provided top-level window.
  ///
  /// Example 1: Using CefBrowserHost::TryCloseBrowser(). This is recommended
  /// for clients using standard close handling and windows created on the
  /// browser process UI thread.
  /// 1.  User clicks the window close button which sends a close notification
  ///     to the application's top-level window.
  /// 2.  Application's top-level window receives the close notification and
  ///     calls TryCloseBrowser() (similar to calling CloseBrowser(false)).
  ///     TryCloseBrowser() returns false so the client cancels the window
  ///     close.
  /// 3.  JavaScript 'onbeforeunload' handler executes and shows the close
  ///     confirmation dialog (which can be overridden via
  ///     CefJSDialogHandler::OnBeforeUnloadDialog()).
  /// 4.  User approves the close.
  /// 5.  JavaScript 'onunload' handler executes.
  /// 6.  Application's DoClose() handler is called and returns false by
  ///     default.
  /// 7.  CEF sends a close notification to the application's top-level window
  ///     (because DoClose() returned false).
  /// 8.  Application's top-level window receives the close notification and
  ///     calls TryCloseBrowser(). TryCloseBrowser() returns true so the client
  ///     allows the window close.
  /// 9.  Application's top-level window is destroyed, triggering destruction
  ///     of the child browser window.
  /// 10. Application's OnBeforeClose() handler is called and the browser object
  ///     is destroyed.
  /// 11. Application exits by calling CefQuitMessageLoop() if no other browsers
  ///     exist.
  ///
  /// Example 2: Using CefBrowserHost::CloseBrowser(false) and implementing the
  /// DoClose() callback. This is recommended for clients using non-standard
  /// close handling or windows that were not created on the browser process UI
  /// thread.
  /// 1.  User clicks the window close button which sends a close notification
  ///     to the application's top-level window.
  /// 2.  Application's top-level window receives the close notification and:
  ///     A. Calls CefBrowserHost::CloseBrowser(false).
  ///     B. Cancels the window close.
  /// 3.  JavaScript 'onbeforeunload' handler executes and shows the close
  ///     confirmation dialog (which can be overridden via
  ///     CefJSDialogHandler::OnBeforeUnloadDialog()).
  /// 4.  User approves the close.
  /// 5.  JavaScript 'onunload' handler executes.
  /// 6.  Application's DoClose() handler is called. Application will:
  ///     A. Set a flag to indicate that the next top-level window close attempt
  ///        will be allowed.
  ///     B. Return false.
  /// 7.  CEF sends a close notification to the application's top-level window
  ///     (because DoClose() returned false).
  /// 8.  Application's top-level window receives the close notification and
  ///     allows the window to close based on the flag from #6A.
  /// 9.  Application's top-level window is destroyed, triggering destruction
  ///     of the child browser window.
  /// 10. Application's OnBeforeClose() handler is called and the browser object
  ///     is destroyed.
