/// The sandbox is used to restrict sub-processes (renderer, GPU, etc) from

/// details.

/// To enable the sandbox on macOS the following requirements must be met:
/// 1. Link the helper process executable with the cef_sandbox static library.
/// 2. Call the cef_sandbox_initialize() function at the beginning of the
///    helper executable main() function and before loading the CEF framework
///    library. See include/wrapper/cef_library_loader.h for example usage.

/// handle on success or NULL on failure. The returned handle should be
